        New Holland is a global full-line agricultural machinery manufacturer. New Holland agricultural products include
        tractors, combine harvesters, balers, forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers, haying tools, seeding
        equipment, hobby tractors, utility vehicles and implements, and grape harvesters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original New Holland Machine Company was founded in 1895 in New Holland, Pennsylvania; it was acquired by
        Sperry Corporation in 1947, then by Ford Motor Company in 1986, and then by FiatAgri in 1991, becoming a
        full-line producer. In 1999, New Holland became a brand of CNH Global (NYSE: CNH), which was majority-owned by
        Fiat Industrial. On 29 September 2013, CNH Global N.V. and Fiat Industrial S.p.A. were merged into CNH
        Industrial N.V., a company incorporated in the Netherlands
      </p>
      <p>
        Fiat Industrial shareholders received one CNH Industrial common share for every Fiat Industrial share held and
        CNH Global shareholders received 3.828 CNH Industrial common shares for every CNH Global common share held. CNH
        Industrial N.V. was subsequently listed on both the NYSE and the Milan stock exchange (Mercato Telematico
        Azionario).
      </p>
      <p>
        New Holland equipment is manufactured all around the world; the current administrative headquarters are in
        Turin, Italy, with New Holland, Pennsylvania serving as the brand's headquarters for North America and home of
        the largest hay tools production facility in the world. With 18 plants spread globally, as well as six joint
        ventures in the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East, the corporation is present in 170 countries worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the firm has received several awards for its products, designs, and innovative features.
        Recently, New Holland presented the NH2, a hydrogen-powered tractor farmers can refill by generating energy from
        renewable sources. New Holland also owns trademarks for specific innovations on its products such as ABS Super
        Steer system, Opti Fan System, Intellifill system, and others
      </p>
      <p>
        New Holland history is the sum and integration of four agricultural brands that merged: Ford, Fiat Trattori,
        Claeys, and New Holland.

        New Holland was founded in 1895 by Abe Zimmerman[2] in New Holland, Pennsylvania and was producing agricultural
        products, including a feed mill, to help the farming community around him (see New Holland Machine Company).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1947, the company changed its name to Sperry New Holland, due to a take over by the Sperry Rand Corporation.
        The same year, it made a major breakthrough in hay harvesting technology with the introduction of the haybine
        mower conditioner. In 1964, Sperry New Holland bought a major interest in Claeys.

              Before this acquisition, Ford had a long history in agricultural machinery production. In 1907, Ford came
